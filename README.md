# customer_analysis
Analyse customer's data.
I conducted a comprehensive customer analysis based on the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment our customer base and identify high-value groups. By evaluating how recently customers made a purchase, how often they bought from us, and how much they spent, I ranked and categorized them into distinct segments. This approach provides actionable insights into customer loyalty, purchasing behavior, and potential churn risks, enabling the business to tailor marketing strategies, enhance retention, and maximize long-term customer value.
